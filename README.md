# RPGGameKit for SpriteKit

— By Amory Rouault —

## Context

I was developing a RPG game using SpriteKit. I struggled a lot when trying to create the basics while implementing my game. I was constantly adding Swift extensions so that Sprite Kit would suit my needs. So I decided to make a game kit that gives me all I need to develop the basics and would let me add features that are specifics to my game.

## Configuration

I use Xcode 12.3.

This kit was made for pixel art so the assets must be 16x16 or 32x32.

The game must me played in landscape mode.

I developed it for iOS.

## Get started

Use the GitHub link to add the package to your Xcode project.

More detail will be added...
